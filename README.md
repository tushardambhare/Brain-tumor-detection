# brain-tumor-classifier

# Description 

A web app that will detect whether patients have tumors and classify the type
and stage.
I have used the CNN Algorithm detection of tumors and built a deep learning
model to classify the type. Also deployed the model using the flask framework.

# Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 
2. requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)

model_final.h5 is the model created with CNN model and that will be used in the app.
